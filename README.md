# Melenoma_Skin_cancer
I see you've uploaded the README template. I'll review the content and suggest any improvements or changes based on the project. Let me retrieve the file content first.

The README template you provided is quite basic. I suggest adapting it to fit your project with more specific information. Below is a version tailored to your melanoma skin cancer detection project:

## General Information
- **Project Purpose**: The objective of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of melanoma skin cancer into 9 different categories.
- **Business Problem**: Early and accurate detection of melanoma skin cancer is crucial for timely treatment. This project aims to create a model that can assist in classifying skin lesions accurately to aid healthcare professionals.
- **Dataset Used**: The dataset consists of images of skin lesions, which are classified into 9 classes. These images are preprocessed and augmented to address issues like overfitting and class imbalance.

## Project Pipeline
1. **Data Reading and Understanding**: Images are loaded, and train/test paths are defined. All images are resized to 180x180.
2. **Dataset Creation**: Train and validation datasets are created from the training directory, and batch size is set to 32.
3. **Dataset Visualization**: Visualized one image from each of the 9 classes.
4. **Model Building**: A CNN model is constructed to classify the images into 9 categories, with pixel normalization (rescaling to (0,1)). An optimizer and loss function are chosen, and the model is trained for 20 epochs.
5. **Data Augmentation**: To address overfitting, data augmentation is applied by rotating, flipping, and zooming images. The model is retrained after augmentation.
6. **Class Imbalance Handling**: Using the Augmentor library, class imbalances are rectified. The model is trained again with 30 epochs.
7. **Model Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated, and improvements are noted.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Augmentor
- Matplotlib

## Results and Conclusions
- **Findings**:
   - Initially, the model showed [overfitting/underfitting], which was addressed through data augmentation.
   - Class imbalance was rectified, and the model performed better on underrepresented classes.
   - The final model performed well, showing [accuracy/performance metrics] after training with augmented and balanced data.
